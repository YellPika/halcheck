\section{Summary}

\begin{frame}{\halcheck{} --- Design --- Summary}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Every generator in \halcheck{} is built from four first-order core functions, enabling a "direct-style" API.
    \item User-defined generation strategies are supported: every core function can be overriden.
    \item Shrinking is performed by changing generator inputs (\mintinline{c++}{gen::shrink}) instead of generator outputs, resulting in less memory usage.
  \end{itemize}
